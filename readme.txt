Adds the ability to mark an event as an Online event and to change an event's status to Canceled or Postponed.

== Description ==

Events marked as Online, Canceled, or Postponed will have a visual representation of those states in views and on the single event page. These event states also get reflected in the event schema with the `eventStatus` and `eventAttendanceMode` defined in Google's JSON-LD `Event` standard.
